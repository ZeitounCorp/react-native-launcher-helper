# react-native run-android

## Requirements

* A bash terminal (Mac-Os || Linux have already it integrated by default)
* Make sure an emulator is opened, check more infos on how to open one by looking at ../open_android_emulator/ 
* Make sure when you run ``` rand ``` that you are in a react-native folder/ project

## Further infos

* ``` cd ~ ```
* ``` nano .bash_profile ```
* Go to the bottom of the file or if empty stay on first line
* write ``` alias rand='react-native run-android' ```
* CTRL + X, when prompt to save, type ``` y ``` and then press the return key
* ``` source ~/.bash_profile ```
* You are done with configs, now go into one of your react-native project and write ``` rand ```   in a terminal window, it will launch the app on the open android emulator

## ENJOY ðŸ˜‰
